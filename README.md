# TeamCity plugin "Who Broke Build"

From JetBrains Hackaton 2015

This plugin should:

* allow to find that guy who has broken the build
* start several builds in parallel
* auto-assign investigation (and note which change(s) broke the build)
* optionally finds the problematic change
* in case of no parallel builds possible, specify bisect strategy to reduce time of check sources out
* double check to prevent mistakes by changing build configuratuion settings or by flikering tests
